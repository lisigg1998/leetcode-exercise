No.389 Find the Difference
=========
Given two strings s and t which consist of only lowercase letters.

String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.

Find the letter that was added in t.

Example:
```
Input:
s = "abcd"
t = "abcde"

Output:
e
```
Explanation:  
  
'e' is the letter that was added.  

## Problem Analysis  

There is only one difference, and the elements' range is fixed (all are lowercase letters), so we can use counting array. Furthermore, we can use "sort + two pointers" or even bit manipulation to solve this problem.   
  

## How To (In C++)
### 1. counting array
```C++
char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);
    int arr[26] = {0};
    for(int i = 0; i < s.size(); i++) {
        arr[s[i] - 'a']++;
    }
    for(int i = 0; i < t.size(); i++) {
        arr[t[i] - 'a']--;
    }
    for(int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        if(arr[i] != 0) return char('a' + i);
    }
    return 0;

}
```

**Time complexity:**  
$O(m+n)$, where m and n are the size of `s` and `t`.  
  
**Space complexity:**  
$O(1)$, since the size of counting array is limited.  

### 2. sorting and two pointers
```C++
char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);
    sort(s.begin(),s.end());
    sort(t.begin(),t.end());
    int i=0, j=0;
    while(i < s.size() && j < t.size()) {
        if(s[i] == t[j]){
            i++;
            j++;
        }
        else return t[j];
    }
    return t[j];

}
```
Since there is only one different element, we compare the two sorted array with two pointers. Once we find the difference, we just return the different character in `t`.  

**Time complexity:**  
$O(nlogn)$. The comparison process will repeates at most n times, depending on the size of two original arrays. However, the sorting algorithm has at least $O(nlogn)$ complexity, dragging the overall efficiency.  
  
**Space complexity:**  
$O(1)$ if original arrays do not count, and sorting algorithm also does not require extra space.

### 3. set intersection method
```C++
char findTheDifference(string s, string t) {
    ios_base::sync_with_stdio(false);
    cin.tie(0);
    cout.tie(0);
    char res = 0;
    int i = 0;
    while(i < s.size()) {
        res ^= s[i] ^ t[i];
        i++;
    }
    return res ^ t[i];
}
```
Remember the features of XOR operation. **When two sequence which only have one place of difference are XORed, the result is the different element.**  

**Time complexity:**  
$O(n)$.  
  
**Space complexity:**  
$O(1)$, this method can generate result inplace.
