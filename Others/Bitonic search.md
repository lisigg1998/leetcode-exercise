Bitonic search Problem
=========
This problem is from problem 1.4.20, Algorithm(4th edition).  
  
An array is bitonic if it is comprised of an increasing sequence of integers followed immediately by a decreasing sequence of integers.
Write a program that, given a bitonic array of `N` distinct int values, determines whether a given integer is in the array. 
Your program should use `~3lg N` compares in the worst case.
